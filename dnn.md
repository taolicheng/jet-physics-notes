> Notes for using DNN in Jet Physics

## DNN
> "Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with **raw data** and to automatically **discover the representations** needed for detection or classification. Deep-learning methods are representation learning methods **with multiple levels of representation** obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level."[LeCun, Bengio, Hinton]

  >By investigating network performance on
  samples from the Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa generators, we find differences of up to **fifty** percent
  in background rejection for fixed signal efficiency.   

## Comments
* the key point is to find the best representation of the data, thus
  * image recognition -> 2D ? but in this format, is all the info sufficiently being encoded?
