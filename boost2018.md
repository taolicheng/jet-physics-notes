## Day 1

#### Ex Overview

#### Th Overview (Ben Nachman)

#### Jet and Missing ET Reconstruction and Calibration (Christofer Young)
* Pile-up subtraction
* 

#### Large-R Jets()
* JMR (jet topologies... W/t/H/qg)

#### PUPPI @ CMS
* **FPGA friendly jet algo.**

-----
## Day 2
#### Pile-up Mitigation (ATLAS and CMS)
* Methods: CHS (Charged Hadron Subtraction), Particle Flow, Pileup Jet ID, PUPPI (Pileup Per Particle Identification), CS (Constituent Subtraction)
* 

#### Boost Tagger Performance (ATLAS and CMS)
* W/Top

#### Jet Substructure Measurements in pp collisions


#### Jet Substructure Measurements in PbPb Collisions
* ALICE:
  * Lund Plane: recluester -> coordinate information -> Lund Plane -> distr.
  * n_(SD): number of splittings passing SD
  * Color decoherence (medium response)
  * tau21 -> obsere large kt medium-induced radiations 
* CMS and ATLAS
  * main issues: underlying events subtraction, 
  * correlated bkg -> (issues in jet clustering)
  * centrality
  * RAA v.s. jet mass (ATLAS)

#### Machine Learning
* AutoEncoder -> signal detection with only bg samples
* LLP and CWoLa, used for high-dimensional data (jet images)
  * loss function for LLP
* CWoLa Bump Hunting
